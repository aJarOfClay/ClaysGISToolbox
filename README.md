# Clay's GIS Toolbox
This is my Python Toolbox that I use in ArcGIS Pro, and you're free to use it too. Tools will be added and updated as I work on them.

## Tool Documentation
### Bulk Download
Download a bunch of files without all the hassle of clicking around!


**Input List**: txt file containing a list of URLs on separate lines. e.g:
```
https://www.example.com/image.jpg
https://www.example.com/index.html
... 
```
**Output Directory**: target folder for the downloaded files. This (should) default to a folder within the current active project once an input file is selected.



## Current and future work
- [ ] Finish up bulk downloader
    - [ ] Skip Existing Files toggle
    - [ ] Add Directory To Project toggle
- [ ] Better plots
- [ ] Some basic raster statistics / analysis
    - [ ] Value histogram / plot
- [ ] Make the toolbox's metadata and documentation work
